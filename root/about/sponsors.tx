# Sponsoring and sponsors

## Become a sponsor

We use <a href="https://opencollective.com/metacpan-core">OpenCollective</a> to manage donations. Please <a href="https://opencollective.com/metacpan-core">donate</a> - regular contributions are 
ideal (to help us budget), but anything you or your company can contribute is appreciated.

## Where does the money go?

As a small open source group of developers we have several things that cost money...

- Running the servers
- 3rd party system support (to help with the servers, if the open source team are not available)
- Data storage (including backups)
- Tools to help us work together better
- Meta::Hack - getting together once a year or so to push development forward
- Hosting other <a href="https://perltoolchainsummit.org/">Perl Toolchain projects</a>

            Bytemark Hosting is the UK's "geek hosting outfit of choice"
            because its programmer &amp; network-engineer team have built it
            that way since 2002, with their own tools, software and technical
            expertise. They understand web applications and network
            infrastructure equally, and host names such as Bostik, dopplr.com
            and Britain's largest mystery shopping company, Retail Eyes. Their
            hosting starts at only £15 per month and runs to multi-site
            managed setups for customers with the fussiest demands of
            reliability and failover.

            email accounts, security, domains, databases, and more. cPanel was

            They've been using Perl for nearly 20 years now, and have long
            been supporters of Perl and its community. You may recognise some

            MetaCPAN.org (the search site) probably would not exist if it
